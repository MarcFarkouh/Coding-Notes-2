			<h1><em>Basic Html language: </em></h1>
		
		<p>
		-Hypertext is a text display that provides access throught other links.
		!DOCTYPE html -Must be the first line of code in your html documents.
		h1 and /h1 - Can alter the size of your text.
		-To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing html tags. <br /><br />
		- p /p -To make a paragraph, you must insert your text inbetween both p tags. <br /><br />
		- head /head -Head contains all the metadata for a web page. <br /><br />
		- Head tags - Allow information to be put inbetween both of the head tags.<br /><br/>
		- Title tags- Allows for a title to be inserted between the title tags.<br /><br />
		- Is used to make line breaks in your code. It may be added in between a paragraph, to split it into several different lines. <br /><br />
        - Body is nests all of the writing on your website. Body is a parent element to div, so they are still related...The p tags are also nested inside the body element. <br /><br /> 		
		- Coments are used to explain your code without effecting the codes functionability.<br /><br />
		- Code tags are used to insert code, without any of the code being executed...  
		</p>
		<!-- This is an example of a comment-->
		
			<h2> Notes on Headers: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- To make headers, you have to add h1 and for any smaller headers add h2, h3, etc...
		</p>
		
			<h2> More Notes on html language: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- Span can seperate a sentence or a certain sentence from the rest of your text. 
		</p>
		
			<h2> Fonts and Line Spacing: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- Em tags is use for <em> italics </em> and strong tags is used for <strong> Bold. </strong><br />
		- To make a line break, use br / to move onto the next line. <br />
		</p>
		
			<h2> Lists: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- UL tags are used to create an unordered list tag. It makes a list in no particular order. The li tags are to describe an item in a list. <br />
		- OL tags are used to create an ordered list then you can add li tags within the Ol tag.
		</p>
		
			<h2> Links: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- The link tags are a and /a. By using href, its attributes are set to a value of the URL. <br />
		<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/"> Link to Wikipedia </a> <br />
		- HTML allows you to turn any element into a link by wrapping that element with an anchor element.It's possible to turn images into links by simply wrapping the img element with an a element. <br />
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opuntia" target="_blank"><img src="#" alt="A red prickly pear fruit"/></a>
		-If you add a target attribute to your link, it will open the link in a new window by adding taget= "blank"
		</p>
		
			<h2> Images and vidoes: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- The image tag allows you to add an image. You must put the image tag and then add the name of the file within that tag. Src must be set to the images source. <br />
		<img src="https://www.hello.com/img_/hello_logo_hero.png" /> <br />
		- Attributes are made up by: The name of the attribute and the value of it. 
		- To insert a video, you must add the video tags... <!-- <Video src="whatever the file name is" width=x length=x controls> then close the video tags with </video> -->
		</p>
		
			<h3> Image Alts: </h3>
		
		<p>
		- Supports visually impared users. Alt can add a description to a picture. It also is used if the image fails, the user can still read a description of the photo, and for visually imapred users, there screen reading software can read the description of the photo. <br />
		</p>
		
			<h2> Files: </h2>
		
		<p>
		- Web developers often store HTML files in the root directory, or a main folder where all the files for the project are stored.
        If the browser is currently displaying index.html, it knows that about.html and contact.html are in the same folder as index.html, also referred to as the current folder. <br />		
		- A relative path is a filename that shows the path to a local file (a file on the same website, such as ./index.html) versus an absolute path (a full url, like www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby which is stored in a different folder). The ./ in ./index.html tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder.
		</p>
		
			<h3> Navigation through your page </h3>
		
		<p>
		 This may help the user of the website to scroll through your page and go to diffrent places of your website by clicking on the link... <br />
		- Linking to elements on the same page or to other pages on the same site is called navigation. HTML has a special tag called nav that is used to wrap these links in order to organize the content on your web page. <br />
		- Non-semantic tags means that they do not describe the content that is inside of them (div tags). However, many tags are used to describe the content that they surround, which helps us modify and style our content later. These are called semantic tags and nav is one of them! <br />
		</p>
		
			<h2> Tables </h2>
		
		<p>
		- Before displaying data, you must first create the table that will contain the data by using the table element. <br />
		- The first step in entering data into the table is to add rows using the table row element: tr tags
		- Rows aren't sufficient to add data to a table. Each cell element must also be defined. In HTML, you can add data using the table data element: td tags. <br />
		- To add titles to rows and columns, you can use the table heading element: th tags <br />
		- Table borders can be used to organize your table. <br />
		- Data can span columns using the colspan attribute. The rowspan attribute is used for data that spans multiple rows. <br />
		- Long tables can be sectioned off using the table body element: tbody. The tbody element should contain the all of the table's data, excluding the table headings. <br />
		- When a table's body is sectioned off, however, it also makes sense to section off the table's headings using the thead element. <br />
		- The bottom part of a long table can also be sectioned off using the tfoot element.<br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<table>
			<tr>
				<th> A table </th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td> Hello </td>
				<td rowspan="2"> Marc! </td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
			<h1> CSS Notes </h1>
		
		<p>
		- Example of a Tag to open your CSS file to allow it in your code, link href="style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" <br />
		- To style an HTML element, you can add the style attribute directly to the opening tag. After you add the attribute, you can set it equal to the CSS style(s) you'd like applied to that element. <br />
		- If you'd like to add more than one style with inline styles, simply keep adding to the style attribute. Make sure to end the styles with a semicolon (;). <br />
		- HTML allows you to write CSS code in its own dedicated section with the style element. CSS can be written between opening and closing style tags. To use the style element, it must be placed inside of the head element.
		- Style p {font-family: Arial;} /style. This example changes the font of the text to Arial. <br />
		- You can create a CSS file by using the .css file name extension, like so: style.css. <br />
		- link href="./style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet". This is an example of linking a CSS file to a html file. <br />
		- You can add HTML elements to your CSS file (ex: P tags), but it is typed out diffrently (p{}) <br />
		- To change colour, you must add inside brackets that have to do with text (ex: h1{maroon;Blue}) <br />
		- CSS is not limited to selecting elements by tag name. HTML elements can have more than just a tag name; they can also have attributes. One common attribute is the class attribute. It's also possible to select an element by its class attribute. The class attribute is set to "brand". (.brand{}) <br />
		- Class tags, need to be added back inot your html file. They are represented with a dot before the name in CSS. (ex: if you add a .uppercase Class in Css, you must add it back in html. h1 class="title uppercase">Top Vacation Spots/h1) <br />
		- To add a ID you need to have a ID attribute in Html. ID names ar erepresented in CSS with #. <br />
		- Chainning selectors means it's possible to require an HTML element to have two or more CSS selectors at the same time.
		- In addition to chaining selectors to select elements, CSS also supports selecting elements that are nested within other HTML elements. This is called Nested Element.
		- There is only one thing that is more specific then ID's which is important tags. They can be applied to specific attributes. They override any style no matter how specific it is. <br />
		- It is suggested to keep away from important tags, and only use if element appears the same way in your code 100% of the time. <br />
		- Multiple sectors are attributes that appear multiple times, within the CSS File. <br /><br />
		</p>
		
		<p>
		- Font size adjusts the size of the font og text through a CSS File. <br />
		- Font Weight properly controls the how bold or thin your text is. You can also add a normal tag that can make a cretain part of your text normal, contrary to the other parts. <br /> 
		- Text allign, allows you to move your text from side to side on your page. You can move your text so you can center in the middle of the page. <br />
		- You can change the backround colour of your file, by adding a backround attribute in your CSS File. <br />
		- You can alter the opacity of your text from a range of 0-100% but it is written from 0-1. <br />
		- You can add a backround image. To add you have to put backround-image: url("The url")<br />
		- An element has two dimensions: height and width. These two dimensions can also be modified size/width. <br />
		- Borders can be set with a specific style, width, color. <br /><br />
		</p>
		
			<h2> Box Model </h2> 
		
		<p>
		- You can add padding between content boxes. You can adjust the size of the spaces between the boxes by adjusting the number of pixels. <br />
		- You can add multiple pixel elements to one padding property, which represents (in this order) top, right side, bottom, left side. <br />
		- The final component to a box model is margins. Margins refer to the spaces right outside of the box. You can also add all pixel elements on one line of CSS code. Margins can be used to center content. <br />
		- Because a web page can be viewed through displays of differing screen size, the content on the web page can suffer from those changes in size. <br />
		- Min-width this property ensures a minimum width of an element's box. Max-width this property ensures a maximum width of an element's box. <br />
		- The overflow property controls what happens to content that spills, or overflows, outside its box. If you have a scroll attached to the overflow, it will allow to scroll through the article. <br />
		- User agent stylesheets often have default CSS rules that set default values for padding and margin. This affects how the browser displays HTML elements, which can make it difficult for a developer to design or style a web page. <br />
		- Elements can be hidden from view with the visibility property. The two elements for visibilty is hidden which hides certain elements, and visible which displays an element. <br />
		- The universal selector (*) targets all elements on the web page and sets their box model to the border-box model. <br />
		</p>
		
			<h2> Positioning </h2>
		
		<p>
		- Another way of modifying the position of an element is by setting its position to absolute. <br />
		- When an element's position is set to absolute all other elements on the page will ignore the element and act like it is not present on the page. When an element's position is set to absolute, as in the last exercise, the element will scroll out of view when a user scrolls. <br />
		- The default display for some tags, such as em, strong, and a, is called inline. Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. The height and width of these elements cannot be specified in the CSS document. <br />
		- Some elements are not displayed in the same line as the content around them. These are called block-level elements. These elements fill the entire width of the page and, unless specified, are the height necessary to accommodate the content inside of them. <br />
		- The third value for the display property is inline-block. Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. <br />
		- The z-index of an element specifies how far back or how far forward an element appears on the page.
		- If you're simply interested in moving an element as far left or as far right as possible on the page, you can use the float property. <br /> 
		- The clear property specifies how elements should behave when they bump into each other on the page. 
		</p>
		
			<h2> Css Colour </h2>
			
		<p>
		- Foreground color is the color that an element appears in. Color: this property styles an element's foreground color. Background-color: this property styles an element's background color.
		- One syntax that we can use to specify colors is called hexadecimal. Colors specified using this system are called hex colors. A hex colour begins with a hash character (#) which is followed by three or six characters. The characters represent values for red, blue and green. <br />
		- RGB, is a syntaxt that takes into account the amount of red, green, and blue in one colour. <br />
		- You can add noth a hexadecimal and a RGB to describe one colour. <br />
		- There's another equally powerful system in CSS called the hue-saturation-lightness color scheme, abbreviated as HSL. Hue is the first number. It refers to an angle on a color wheel. Saturation refers to the intensity or purity of the color. Lightness refers to how light or dark the colour is. <br />
		- Opacity and Alpha can be added to HSL to make HSLA, which gives the colour 4 values. Opacity is used in decimal numbers from 0-1. 
		</p>
		
			<h2> Typography </h2>
		
		<p> 
		- There are different types of fonts family's that can be changed. <br />
		- Use font style to adjust the style of your font, such as adding bold, and italics. <br />
		- You can adjust the space inbetween each word by word spacing,then adding a quantity between 0 and 1 and after add em. <br />
		- You can adjust the space between letters by adding letter-spacing, and then an amount between 0 and 1, then add em. <br />
		- head link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Droid+Serif" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" /head. This is an example of linking fonts, within the head tag. <br />
		- You can load an external font in a stylesheet using the font-face property. We can modify our @font-face rule to use local font files as well. We can supply the user with the desired font family and host it along with our site instead of depending on a different site. <br />
		</p>
	
			<h2> Grids </h2>
		
		<p>
		- We can define the columns of our grid by using the CSS property grid-template-columns. This property causes two changes, it can tell how many columns there are, and second the width of each of these columns. <br />
		- To specify the number and size of the rows, we are going to use the property grid-template-rows. This is almost exactly the same as adding columns. <br />
		- You can add the grid template property to combine the rows and the columns in one property, which are seperated with a /. <br />
		- The repeat function will duplicate the specifications for rows or columns a given number of times. <br />
		- Minmax is a property that can adjust the size of a graph based on the size of your webpage. For example, if you have a 100-pixel wide image in your grid, you probably don't want its column to get thinner than 100 pixels! The minmax() function can help us solve this problem. <br />
		- 
		
		</p>
		
		
			<h1> JavaScript </h1>
		
		<p>
		- The console log property is used to print or log, text to the console. It displays whatever is put in the console.log property, on the page. <br />
		- Data types are the building blocks of all languages and essential pieces of any program. <br />
        - Strings — Any grouping of keyboard characters (letters, spaces, numbers, or symbols) surrounded by single quotes ('Hello') or double quotes ("World!"). In the example above, 'New York City' is a string. <br />
	    - Numbers — Any number, including numbers with decimals: 4, 1516, .002, 23.42. In the example above, 40.7 is a number. <br />
        - Booleans — Either true or false, with no quotations. In the example above, true is a boolean. <br />
		- Null — Can only be null. It represents the absence of value. <br />
		- You can use math simples within a string, and it will projecxt the result of the problem. <br />
		- When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program, the browser saves it as an instance of the data type. An instance is an individual case (or object) of a data type. <br />
		- Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in it. You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name. <br />
		- While the length of a string is calculated when an instance is created, a string instance also has methods that calculate new information as needed. <br />
		- When these built-in methods are called on an instance, they perform actions that generate an output. Built-in methods are called, or used, by appending an instance with a period, the name of the method, and opening (() and closing ()) parentheses. <br />
		- Console.log('Codecademy'.toUpperCase()); This is an example of how to make script within console log, being all capitals. <br />
		- Console.log(Math.random()); chooses a random number between the numbers 0-1. To ensure the answer is a whole number, JavaScript provides a built-in method called Math.floor(). Math.floor() takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. <br />
		- const myAge = 11;
			console.log(myAge); 
			// Output: 11
		- This example above creates a variable, then asks it to be printed on the page. <br />
		- JavaScript threw an error because you assigned a new value to a constant variable. Constant variables, as their name implies, are constant — you cannot assign them a different value. <br />
		- JavaScript creates space for this variable in memory and sets it to undefined. Undefined is the fifth and final primitive data type. <br />
		- Lines of code between curly braces are called blocks. if/else statements have two code blocks. If the variable needsCoffee is true, the program will run the first block of code. Otherwise, it will run the other block of code. <br />
		- needsCoffee is the condition we are checking inside the if's parentheses. Since it is equal to true, our program will run the code between the first opening curly brace { (line 2) and the first closing curly brace } (line 4). It will ignore the else { ... } part. In this case, we'd see Finding coffee log to the console. <br />
		- If needsCoffee were false, only the console.log() statement in the else block would be executed. <br />
